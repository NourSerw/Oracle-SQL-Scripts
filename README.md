Oracle SQL Scripts


I have decided to centralize all the scripts that are helpful for me or anyone else that I use on a daily or less than often.

There are a number of scripts that are extremely useful yet alas there are too many to commit to memory. Thus this repo has been
created to solve that dilemma. 

If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact me.
